The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing 
a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear 
acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 

This assignment extracted observations of the mean and standard deviation measurements in the X, Y, and Z directions. These observations
were averaged for each activity/subject pair. 't' indicates a timeseries signal while 'f' indicates a frequency series signal

Mean and std for the following measurements are found.  
tBodyAcc- Body acceleration- timeseries data  
tGravityAcc- Gravitational acceleration- timeseries data  
tBodyAccJerk- Body 'jerk' acceleration- timeseries data  
tBodyGyro- Body gyroscopic movement
tBodyGyroJerk- Body gyroscopic 'jerk' movement
fBodyAcc- frequency of body acceleration
fBodyAccJerk- frequency of body 'jerk' acceleration
fBodyGyro- frequency of body gyroscopic movement
